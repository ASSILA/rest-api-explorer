        Tasks are returned for which the authenticated user is the assignee  or
        a candidate. If networks are enabled, the only tasks that are inside
        the given network are returned.

        In non-network deployments, administrators can see all processes and
        perform all operations on tasks. In network deployments, network

        An authenticated user will have access to a task if the user has

        tasks. In a network, only tasks that are inside the given network are

        Updates the state of the task **taskId**.
        
        To perform a task action the authenticated user must be the assignee  or
        a candidate. If networks is enabled, the task action is only
        performed  if the task is inside the given network.

        In non-network deployments, administrators can perform all operations
        on  tasks. In network deployments, network administrators can see all
        tasks  in their network and perform all operations on tasks in their
        network.
        
        You use the **select** parameter in the URL to specify a comma-separated list of 
        properties in the 
        task that you want to update. Use the JSON body to specify the new values for those
        properties. 
        
        So for example to change the state of task **123** to **completed**, use
        this URL
        http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/workflow/versions/1/tasks/123?select=state, and 
        provide this request body:
        
        ```JSON
        {  
          "state": "completed"
        }
        ```
        State Transitions
        =================
        
        Clients can invoke actions by assigning an allowed value to the state property of a task.
        The select parameter can be used to allow for a partial update of the resource. 
        Alfresco will check for illegal state transitions and return an HTTP Bad Request (Response 400) 
        if an illegal state transition is attempted. 
        There are five state transitions, completing, claiming, unclaiming, delegating, resolving.
        
        Completing a task
        -----------------
        
        If variables are included in the JSON body, they will be set in the task and then the process will continue.
        
        To complete a task, the authenticated user must be the assignee of the task, the owner of the task, or have started the process.
        
        In non-network deployments, administrators can perform this task operation on all tasks.
        In network deployments, network administrators can perform this action on all tasks in their network.
        
        Here's an example PUT request
        
        ```
        /tasks/123?select=state,variables
        ```
        Here's is a corresponding PUT request body:
        
        ```JSON
        {
          “state : “completed”,
          “variables” : [
          {
            "name" : "bpm_priority",
            "type" : "d_int",
            "value" : 1,
            "scope" : "global"
          }
         ]
        }
        ```
        
        Claiming a task
        -----------------
        
        To claim a task, the authenticated user must be the assignee of the task, 
        the owner of the task, or have started the process.
        
        Here's an example PUT request
        
        ```
        /tasks/123?select=state
        ```
        Here's a corresponding PUT request body:
        
        ```JSON
        {
          “state : “claimed”
        }
        ```
        
        Unclaiming a task
        -----------------
        
        This removes the current assignee of the task.
        
        To unclaim a task, the authenticated user must be the assignee of the task, 
        the owner of the task, or have started the process.
        
        Here's an example PUT request
        
        ```
        /tasks/123?select=state
        ```
        Here's a corresponding PUT request body:
        
        ```JSON
        {
          “state : “unclaimed”
        }
        ```
        
        Delegating a task
        -----------------
        
        This delegates the task from the owner to an assignee. 
        The result is the same as if the assignee had claimed the task, 
        but the task can then be resolved and the owner will
        become the assignee again.
        
        To delegate a task, the authenticated user must be the 
        assignee of the task and the assignee must be different from the owner.
        
        Here's an example PUT request
        
        ```
        /tasks/123?select=state,assignee
        ```
        Here's a corresponding PUT request body:
        
        ```JSON
        {
          “state : “delegated”,
          “assignee : “Kermit”
        }
        ```
        Resolving a task
        -----------------
        
        This returns a delegated task back to the owner. 
        In order to delegate a task, the authenticated user 
        must be the assignee of the task and the assignee must 
        be different from the owner.
        
        To resolve a task, the authenticated user must be 
        the assignee of the task, the owner of the task, 
        or have started the process.
        
        Here's an example PUT request
        
        ```

      A deployment resource represents one file inside a deployment.

      Process files, forms and perhaps some other files are authored in
      a separate environment. The act of deployment brings them into the runtime
      workflow engine.

      A deployment is a collection of files that include all resources to specify
      one or more process definitions. After deployment, the included process
      definitions are known to the workflow runtime engine and new processes can
      be started.

      Users can then continue to edit the process and other files in their
      authoring environment like e.g. our eclipse based process editor.
      A redeployment will result in a complete separate deployment containing new
      versions of the process definition.

      When a process definition inside a new deployment has the same key as an
      existing process definition, then it is considered a new version of the
      existing process definition.

      A process describes a running instance of a process definition.

      When a new deployment includes a process definition that is already
      deployed with the same key, the newly deployed process definition will be
      considered a new version of the same process definition. By default
      processes will keep running in the process definition they are started in.
      But new processes can be started in the latest version of a process
      definition by using the processDefinitionKey parameter.

      In non-network deployments, administrators can see all processes and
      perform all operations on tasks. In network deployments, network
      administrators can see processes in their network and perform all
      operations on tasks in their network.
